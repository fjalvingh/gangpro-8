Make the Gangpro-8 send the content of the EPROM/PROM/ROM as follows:
* Select the correct device type with the DEVICE key
* Insert the EPROM to read in the MASTER socket (SKTM).
* MAKE SURE THAT ALL OTHER SOCKETS ARE EMPTY!!
* Press the SETUP key multiple times until the display says "UPLOAD".
This should start the upload, I'll tell you when I'm starting to see data.
